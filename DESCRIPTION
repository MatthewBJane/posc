Description: The bivariate relationship between a continuous predictor and a continuous outcome is 
conventionally reported as a correlation coefficient and displayed with a scatter plot. Correlations and 
scatter plots are often difficult to accurately interpret in a probabilistic manner. Common language effect 
size indicators are occasionally used to aid in interpreting effect sizes. The bivariate probability of 
superiority is the common language effect size alternative to the correlation coefficient, it is defined as 
the probability of someone scoring higher (or lower) in an outcome when also scoring higher in some predictor. 
However, the probability of scoring higher in the outcome changes depending on the magnitude of the difference 
in X. Here we introduce a probability of outcome superiority curve (POSCs) which captures the conditional 
probability of superiority given a difference in the predictor. The application of these curves is most useful 
when applied to decision-making situations such as applicant selection. For example, a POSC computes the 
probability that person A has a higher outcome (e.g. job performance) than person B given a specified difference 
in the predictor variable (e.g., cognitive ability).
